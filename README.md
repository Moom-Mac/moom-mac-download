## 🧩 What is Moom for Mac?

**Moom for Mac** is a window management utility designed to make multitasking on macOS smoother, faster, and more intuitive. If you constantly resize, rearrange, or snap windows across your screen, Moom automates the process and gives you more control over your workspace layout.

When you hover over the green zoom button of any macOS window, Moom presents you with several layout options — move, resize, fullscreen, split-screen, or custom grid arrangements. You can also set up keyboard shortcuts to snap windows instantly to predefined positions (e.g., left half, right third, fullscreen, etc.).

Moom is perfect for:

- Developers managing code editors, terminals, and browsers side by side  
- Designers juggling multiple app windows or reference images  
- Students and writers using split-screen note-taking setups  
- Power users who crave full control over desktop space

One of Moom’s standout features is the **Custom Layout Builder**, which lets you define complex window arrangements and trigger them with a single keystroke. This is especially useful on ultrawide monitors or multi-monitor setups.

You can even create **automatic window layouts** that activate when specific apps launch. With full macOS integration, Apple Silicon support, and a minimal learning curve, Moom turns macOS window management from a chore into a productivity boost.
